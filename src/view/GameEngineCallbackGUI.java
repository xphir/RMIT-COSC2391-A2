 *  As part of your new implementation you must write a GameEngineCallbackGUI class that is added to the 
 *  GameEngine via the existing addGameEngineCallback() method. This class will be responsible for managing 
 *  all of the graphical updates as the game is played. NOTE: this class should not actually implement 
 *  the UI functionality but instead for cohesion it should call methods on other classes, especially the view. 
 *  To state another way, it must be the entry point for any UI code resulting from game play, in order to 
 *  avoid coupling between the GameEngine and the UI which is counter to the original specification.
